POUND is a Wiki/Blog engine I developed in the early 2000s. I hosted my own content on it,
as well as that from a few friends. It was one of the better of my programming projects,
in that I learned a lot of different technology stacks that I wouldn't work with much on
the job (work-wise I tend to focus on much lower levels of the tech stack).

I stopped working on it when I stopped posting regularly to my own hosted blog and started
using G+ instead, although my interest had waned considerably by then.

To use:
My mod_perl stuff needs to be hooked up to Perl and Apache2 to
function. I inserted the following into my /etc/httpd/conf.d/perl.conf:

-------------------------------------------
LoadModule perl_module modules/mod_perl.so
PerlRequire /home/pgunn/mod_perl/poundstub.pl

<Location /live>
        SetHandler perl-script
        PerlResponseHandler MyApache::POUND4
</Location>

-------------------------------------------

You also need Postgres installed, and configured to run in password mode.
Enjoy.
