	How to handle shared purpose between web submissions of blog entries and
	CL submissions

Options: 
1) Toss it in the database and then ask it somehow to parse the submission, via
	a) wget
	b) Rely on Daemon process to handle it
2) Have pndc parse post, POST it like a webclient would
	Issues:
		Authentication
3) Have it write natively into correct database format
	a) Share code via a module with POUND proper
	b) Have it seperately understand the format. Maintenance nightmare.

Side issues:
	* Client won't have separate Subject field. Need to have a special
		means for inline setting of topic, or otherwise handle this
		in a way that won't make the web client deal with this kind
		of thing.
		* Perhaps use [!Subject=This is a Subject] format. This has the
			benefit of being easily generable for text clients
			inline, allowing easy singlefile dumps of entries.
			It's extensible to other entry attributes too, like
			topics.
