The parser for the Wiki format is implemented in POUNDMarkup.pm
It is designed to convert Wiki documents, similar but not identical to
the MediaWiki format, into HTML and any other formats that would be
useful.

It is a multi-pass parser without a formal grammar. There are three
primary classifications of passes:

document-level
line-level
element-level

The document-level passes are designed for two purposes
First, some entry-time information is captured (and removed from the document)
when the document is initially introduced into the system, and is then moved
into other database tables. Secondly, other tags are available that tweak the
behavior of the display engine. Document-level passes use markup tags that
look like this:
[!SOMETHING]

When it makes sense, the second type of document-level passes should be moved
into database tables eventually.

Line-level passes are designed to handle markup that is dependant on
line-level structure of the document. This ranges from the double-newline
becoming a paragraph break to the block-level markups (lists and similar).
The block-level markup is managed by what is essentially a state machine.

Element-level passes handle other markup that's not dependant on being
whitespace aware. Markup of this sort that involves opening and closing
characteristics does not restrain its action to within a single line -- these
filters work over the entire document.
